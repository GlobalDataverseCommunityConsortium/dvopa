# dvopa - a Dataverse Kubernetes Operator

This project aims at creating a [Kubernetes Operator](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator)
 to deploy and maintain a [cloudly Dataverse installation](http://k8s-docs.gdcc.io).

To continue with puns: `dvopa` means `Dataverse Operator`, yet _opa_ references to the german nickname for
a grandfather. Like a guarding grandpa it will take care of children and grandchildren pods, will read fairy tales
to your cluster and books to your deployment.

## Technology

- Java 11
- [Quarkus](https://quarkus.io) to be as small and native as possible
- [Quarkus K8s client](https://quarkus.io/guides/kubernetes-client)
- [Java Operator SDK](https://github.com/java-operator-sdk/java-operator-sdk) (let's give this a whirl)
- Maven + [JKube](https://www.eclipse.org/jkube/docs)
